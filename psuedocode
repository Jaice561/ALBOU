Built a deck of card || organized one

Shuffle the deck of card || randomize it

After Shuffling || randomized: two random card will be display


Player will be provided option to pick either card


The logic is: If player choose card one instead of card two, the deck of card will flip each card to see which is first
&& If card number one is flip first then player one win!

else player looses

and repeat the whole process when after declare a winner or a looser
reset function and creating a for or a while loop



Build the card deck
put the cards number, suits in a array, to lay them out

Shuffle the deck
I’m not clear on how to do that yet, but I Looked it up, 
I think I’m suppose to add a shuffle function and add a loop for every single item in the array

Randomly select a card
add a function that pick two random number in the array after the, the card is shuttle

first, add an addEventListener click function to flip both random card

Win/loss logic
If and else statement
If (card value pick === the first card display in the deck) { player will win
}
else if (card value 2 === the first card display) { player will lose 
}

first I would need to call couple variable and set them equal to zero for winner and loser 

How will you repeat the processHow will you repeat the process
create a reset function and creating a for or a while loop so that process start over
