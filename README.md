 Name of the game = Albou
 
 It's a card game that is play for money. 
 I grew playing this game, and I've won and lost some.
 The reason the game is play for money is because with out the money aspect of it, the game would be very boring.
 But it does get interesting when one get familiar with cards by learning how to count and mark your card

 The game is a two player game. 
 The way the game is played; 
 First of all, the deck need to be shuffle;
 Two card need to be flip after shuffling
 The player that is not distributing the card need to choose a card,
 After choosing the card, the dealer need to go through the card to see which one of the card come first.
 If the card that the other player choose come first, the he win the amount of money he put in there.
