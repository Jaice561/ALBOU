# ALBOU
 Albou is a card game that is played for money. I grew up playing this game in Haiti, and I've won some and lost some. The reason the game is played for money is that without the money aspect of it, the game would be very boring. Because money is involved it gets interesting; the money aspect of it gives people a reason to want to win; So one either gets familiar with cards by learning how to count card or one learn how to mark your card.

The game is a two-player game, and the way to play the game is to first, shuffle the deck; after the dealer shuffles the deck, two-card need to be flip; after the two-cards are flip, the other player needs to choose a card, after choosing the card, the dealer needs to go through the card to see which one of the card come first. In this case, the player will be clicking on the deck until the cards are a match. If the card that the other player chooses comes first, he will win the amount of money that he put on the bet, if not, the dealer will win the bet.
